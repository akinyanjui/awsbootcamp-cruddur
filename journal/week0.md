# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
Created two budgets. A ZeroSpend and CreditUsage budgets with set thresholds at 80%. 
Created MFA for RootUSer. 
Watched the security tutorial which basically explained the importance of cloud security. Showing the variation in users, roles and policies and how they all come to play in ensuring the security of an organization. I was compelled to add security features by adding an MFA on both the Root and IAM users. 
Used lucid charts to create build both a logical and architectural Model.
