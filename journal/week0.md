# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
Started of by creating 2 budgets, zerospend and creditusage budget on the AWS console. This was a much easier task compared to using the CLI on Gitpod. I experienced a few challenges while runnning the budget json code. I identified the problem was with account_id connection and resorted to resolving it manually. Using Gitpod provided a new and exciting experience, and still trying to learn more of it through repeated excersises. For account security, i added a MFA for the root user. And finally, using the lucid charts to create an architectural model gave me a better understanding of the entire project. Find below a snapshot of the model.
