# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
## Week 1 Summary
This week was quite comprehensive with a lot of detail. The best part being about learning containerization and how docker images work, and the various security features employed. e.g Snyk and Clair. I utilized ChatGP to learn more of its day to day use in applications development. Other resources I used where OpenAPI and Youtube. I also followed through the steps in creating the notifications feature which was a success. However, with a bit of challenges while trying to understand what each line of code did to implement a Backend endpoint.  I also took it upon myself to learn more on the functions of APIs and React Flask Coding.
